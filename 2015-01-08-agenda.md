  * [Attribute API 2](https://github.com/opscode/chef-rfc/pull/77)
    1. New attribute API should be method calls, and not use the [] syntax at all
    1. desired and current state should be seperated
    1. we still need per-node persistent storage
    1. per-node consistent storage may just be slang for "desired state", but probably isn't all of it and must be in the RFC
    killing [] from api 2
