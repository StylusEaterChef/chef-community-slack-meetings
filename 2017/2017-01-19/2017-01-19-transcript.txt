Hello everyone!

[12:01]
Happy New Year and welcome back to our regular cadence of weekly Chef Developer meetings


slackbot BOT [12:01 PM] Only visible to you
Pssst! I didn’t unfurl https://github.com/chef/chef-community-slack-meetings/blob/master/2017-01-19-agenda.md because it was already shared in this channel quite recently (within the last hour) and I didn’t want to clutter things up.

nathenharvey [12:01 PM]
As @thom mentioned above, our agenda for today can be found on GitHub - https://github.com/chef/chef-community-slack-meetings/blob/master/2017-01-19-agenda.md

[12:01]
We'll have a couple of updates and then work through some of the open PRs.

[12:01]
I'll get us started with the community update.

[12:02]
ChefConf is coming.  Tickets are on sale now.
The CFP closed yesterday so now the committee has the task to go through the 200 or so talk submissions and select 30 or so that will end up creating the afternoon program for ChefConf.

[12:03]
You should have received an email earlier this week about tickets being on sale and that email should have included a discount for contributors.

[12:04]
ChefConf officially kicks off on Monday, May 22 with training workshops, a Chef Community Summit, and a Habitat Community Summit.  That's followed by two days of conferencing and we close out the week on Thursday with a hack day.

[12:05]
Really hope to see each of you there

[12:05]
Watch https://chefconf.chef.io/2017/ for all the details

[12:05]
including a fun "teaser" video

[12:06]
That's the community update for today.  Let's move on to software releases.

[12:06]
Who has some updates on that front to share?

tduffield [12:06 PM]

Anyone else have software updates to share?

tas50 [12:09 PM]
Foodcritic 8.2 with new chef version metadata. It’ll be in the next ChefDK

thom [12:09 PM]
a couple of Berkshelf releases which’ll be in the next ChefDK

afiune [12:10 PM]
Also new features in the delivery-cli will be released in the next ChefDK :slightly_smiling_face: - Specifically to the `delivery local` command.

nathenharvey [12:11 PM]
OK!  thanks

[12:12]
I'd like to remind everyone to take a few minutes to review the current status of our accepted RFCs - https://chef.github.io/chef-rfc/

[12:12]
Send PRs for any changes that need to be made, please

[12:12]
Our first PR for today is https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/236
GitHub
Add Sous Chefs to reserved prefixes by josephholsten · Pull Request #236 · chef/chef-rfc · GitHub
This is a proposal to add Sous Chefs to the registered prefixes. Chef Brigade has agreed to do this, so we're ready to merge.


[12:13]
@robbkidd @nshamrell if y'all are OK with that one, I believe it's ready for merging

coderanger [12:13 PM]
That doesn't really need to be discussed unless someone objects, just needs supermarket team approval

nshamrell [12:13 PM]
:thumbsup:

nathenharvey [12:13 PM]
@coderanger yep.  Also good to mention it here so everyone see it being approved.

[12:14]
Our next PR is similarly uncontroversial (famous last words) - https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/248
GitHub
Update RFC41 to reflect the reality of Chef Server by thommay · Pull Request #248 · chef/chef-rfc · GitHub
The RFC specifies /server_api_version in some places and /server_api_versions in others. Chef Server implements the former endpoint, so let's use that consistently. cc @marcparadise @chef/chef-serv...


[12:14]
this looks ready for merging

coderanger [12:14 PM]
:+1:

nathenharvey [12:15 PM]
OK, moving along then to https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/237/
GitHub
Added client-rb-logger.md by zfjagann · Pull Request #237 · chef/chef-rfc · GitHub
chef-rfc - Public RFCs for Chef and related projects


coderanger [12:16 PM]
I think this still needs a more detailed spec

thom [12:16 PM]
I’m unconvinced that this RFC actually is implementable in current form

coderanger [12:17 PM]
Good idea overall, but needs specifics to judge it on

nathenharvey [12:18 PM]
I move that we put this on hold then until such time as the spec is further fleshed out.

[12:19]
OK.  Next up:  https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/238
GitHub
Attributes dot Next by lamont-granquist · Pull Request #238 · chef/chef-rfc · GitHub
This builds out a new API in parallel with the old API, with slightly different simplified semantics, emits deprecation warnings for cases where the semantics differ, and then gradually deprecates ...


thom [12:20 PM]
on hold

nathenharvey [12:20 PM]
oops...so it is :slightly_smiling_face:

[12:20]
on to  https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/245

coderanger [12:20 PM]
Lamont has been on a well deserved vacation so imagine not much has changed

nathenharvey [12:21 PM]
245 is an RFC for removing unused metadata fields

coderanger [12:21 PM]
If @thom is happy with 245 :+1: from me

lamont [12:22 PM]
yeah i haven’t touched 238, need to page back in some braincells that got written to disk down in MX

thom [12:22 PM]
i like ripping things out, and i’m currently mucking with the cookbook metadata stuff anyway, so this seems like a good time

tas50 [12:22 PM]
245 would be great to get in formally. We’ve sorta deprecated them already by removing docs, but we should do it for reals

lamont [12:22 PM]
already deprecated some of them in foodcritic

tas50 [12:22 PM]
that too

thom [12:23 PM]
@nathenharvey i think this is votable

nathenharvey [12:23 PM]
let's do it!  :+1:  or :-1:?

[12:23]
(my vote is just to give something clickable, not actually a :-1:) (edited)

thom [12:24 PM]
Since this is the last thing, I’d like to get maintainer votes on https://github.com/chef/chef/pull/5728 , which adds @tduffield as a chef maintainer

nathenharvey [12:25 PM]
245 is approved.  Let's get some thumbs on that PR from @tduffield

afiune [12:26 PM]
:tada:

ssd [12:26 PM]
:penguindance:

nathenharvey [12:26 PM]
yay!

[12:27]
we still have 23 minutes left ... any other business you'd like to bring up or discuss?

tduffield [12:27 PM]
:corn: :cow: :hash:

nathenharvey [12:28 PM]
nom nom nom

[12:28]
OK, let's call this meeting adjourned and we'll meet here again next Thursday, January 26, 2017 9AM-9:50AM PST.
