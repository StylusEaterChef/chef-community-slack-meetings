thom [12:06 PM]
the first 13 nightlies landed in current a couple of days ago


[12:06]
for chef client

tas50 [12:07 PM]
Fauxhai 4.0.2

nathenharvey [12:08 PM]
OK, moving on in the agenda, this is a reminder to review the current status of our RFCs here - https://chef.github.io/chef-rfc/

[12:08]
O

[12:08]
K

[12:08]
:slightly_smiling_face:

[12:08]
Sorry ... our first PR to review is from @coderanger - https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/256

coderanger [12:10 PM]
So we don't actually have a status set up for this

[12:10]
But we should do sometbing

[12:10]
Because this isn't the only accepted rfc that is an unfounded mandate

thom [12:10 PM]
did we not have on hold? but yes, we should add something

coderanger [12:10 PM]
And users are getting confused

nathenharvey [12:10 PM]
The RFC workflow doesn't have "on-hold" https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc000-rfc-process.md#rfc-review-and-workflow

ryanh [12:11 PM]
Or a backlog type status

coderanger [12:11 PM]
Happy to call it whatever :)

ryanh [12:11 PM]
Seems like it could be transferred to chef proper at some point if the status reflects appropriately.

thom [12:12 PM]
@ryanh we remain nervous about people using the RFC process to jam work on to chef’s backlog :slightly_smiling_face:


nathenharvey [12:12 PM]
The time between "accepted" and "final" could probably use 2 new stages.  "In process" and "On hold". (edited)

thom [12:13 PM]
but I think On Hold is a suitable addition to the workflow, and suitable description of the RFC in question

[12:13]
I think Accepted =~ In Process

coderanger [12:13 PM]
Yeah

[12:13]
Within the accuracy level of that field

nathenharvey [12:13 PM]
fair enough

ryanh [12:13 PM]
Maybe a clearer: `Accepted: On Hold` type thing (edited)

coderanger [12:14 PM]
We could also use Withdrawn

[12:14]
And have stuff that goes on hold transition back to Draft

[12:14]
So it has to be re accepted if thawed

[12:14]
But probably overkill

ryanh [12:14 PM]
Or `Accepted: Adopt Me`


[12:14]
heh

thom [12:15 PM]
hmm, i think that’s probably generalising from this specific case

coderanger [12:15 PM]
And all I care about here is not confusing people into thinking this feature exists

damacus [12:15 PM]
`Accepted: Not Implemented`

thom [12:15 PM]
but yeah, for right now, let’s just make in `On Hold` and get someone with some CSS chops to make the html put big red lines through it or something

coderanger [12:16 PM]
-1 for encouraging adoption, most of these things that should be on hold are that way because even people really familiar with chef internals couldn't figure out how to do them

[12:16]
Would be setting people up for pain

robbkidd [12:16 PM]
`Status: We Agree It Sounds Good, But Turns Out It's Hard`?


nathenharvey [12:17 PM]
• *On hold* - The RFC has been approved but is not currently being implemented.

coderanger [12:17 PM]
I'll write up some changes to rfc 0


nathenharvey [12:18 PM]
So I recommend we get rfc-0 updated to reflect the status but can provisionally approve this PR in the meantime.

coderanger [12:18 PM]
Works for me

thom [12:18 PM]
WFM

nathenharvey [12:18 PM]
great.  let's move on to https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/252

[12:19]
add some critical chef-sugar helpers

thom [12:19 PM]
(merged - we can cook up a separate RFC 0 change) (edited)


[12:20]
I think @lamont clarified his position greatly with https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/252#issuecomment-287167226

[12:21]
I also think that I’m happy to approve this RFC, given a vote

coderanger [12:21 PM]
:+1:


nathenharvey [12:22 PM]
OK, that's the end of our planned agenda, too.

thom [12:23 PM]
do we want to vote, or do i just smoosh the big red approved label?

martinisoft [12:23 PM]
I tossed in a vote on @coderanger’s vote

thom [12:24 PM]
works for me

[12:24]
thanks!

shortdudey123 [12:25 PM]
Can we discuss https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/246 since it is past March 15?


nathenharvey [12:26 PM]
YES!  Here's the status update:  It's on me to get some words written and the deprecation in place.  And on my schedule to complete tomorrow


shortdudey123 [12:26 PM]
Awesome sauce

nathenharvey [12:27 PM]
Any other topics?

[12:28]
OK, that's the end of our meeting today then.  See everyone next week - Thursday, March 30, 2017 9AM-9:50AM PDT
