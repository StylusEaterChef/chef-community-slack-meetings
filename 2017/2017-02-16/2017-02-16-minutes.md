  * [build-essential 8.0](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/build-essential)
* In the last week, releases of apt and yum cookbooks that removed the repository resources since those are built into chef. That eliminates a pile of deprecations warnings on every run.


* Chef Client
  * Februaryâ€™s release will be the last feature release in the 12 series.
  * March release will only contain critical bug fixes
  * No plans currently to release Chef Server 13, since Chef Server 12 will be forward compatible with Chef Client 13

### Cookbook Support Policy

* Some discussion around how we announce wide-ranging breaking changes to cookbooks like the current changes underway moving cookbooks to require Chef 12.5 or greater
* The Chef Software Cookbook Engineering team (@tas50, @sigje, @cheeseplus) will post to Discourse the current plans and a regular update with the progress toward that plan.
