no prs to review today, so we'll run through our updates and then open to floor for other business

[12:02]
I'll get us started with the Community update

[12:03]
ChefConf talk acceptances went out yesterday.  Watch the website for updates to the schedule soon.

[12:03]
Really excited about the content we'll have but also saddened by the number of great talks we couldn't fit into the schedule.

As with previous years, we are offering Diversity Scholarships to for people from underrepresented areas of our community.  More details here - https://chefconf.chef.io/2017/diversity-scholarship/

[12:05]
That's the Community update.  Now on to software releases....

[12:05]
What software updates would you like to share?

Foodcritic 9.0 was released with a fix for templates not included in the default directory and changes to the default command line values that make it easier to use out of the box

nathenharvey [12:08 PM]
Other releases from the discussion forums - https://discourse.chef.io/c/chef-release

• Chef Automate Release 0.6.136
• Supermarket 2.8.61 released
• Chef Server 12.12.0 Released
• Chef 13 Announcement
• ChefDK 1.2 Released (edited)

[12:09]
OK, seems we might not have any additional updates

[12:10]
with no PRs to review I'd like to open the floor for additional content.  What would you like to discuss?

[12:13]
OK, that's today's meeting.  Our next meeting is scheduled for next Thursday, February 9, 2017 9AM-9:50AM PST.  *HOWEVER* if we have no PRs to review we'll likely cancel because some of us, myself included, will be on-site at the :habitat: workshop following Configuration Management Camp - http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/fringe.html#habitat

[12:13]
We will make a decision on Monday at the latest.

[12:13]
Thank you all!
