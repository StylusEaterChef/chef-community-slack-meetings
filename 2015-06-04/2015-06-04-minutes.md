### Chef Client and Server Update

    * new subcommands to allow management of keys for the key rotation features introduced in past chef server releases
    * fixes for some nagging Windows bugs
  * chef server 12.1.0.rc was released last week
    * policyfile endpoint fully enabled
    * more details [in a recent blog post](https://www.chef.io/blog/2015/05/28/chef-server-12-1-0-rc-1-now-available/)
    * this RC did have a couple of regressions, and we'll be rolling a new RC next week to fix those up
    * Aiming for a full release of 12.4.0 the week after next
  * Releasing knife-windows 1.0.0.rc.0 gem
    * longer term more of the functionality there should be available to Chef / ChefDK users without installing the separate knife-windows gem
    * easier to configure the matrix of winrm settings you want now, e.g. use negotiate + ssl, or use basic auth and no ssl.
    * a bunch of new subcommands to help set up a winrm endpoint with ssl, like 'knife windows cert install' for those who are working on a non-windows workstation and can't use negotiate without ssl.
    * new 'knife wsman test' command to debugging issues
    * more info in the [release notes](https://github.com/chef/knife-windows/blob/v1.0.0.rc.0/RELEASE_NOTES.md)
