### [Cookbook Quality Metrics](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/147)
* Status:  Pending
* Discussion:
  * Generally in favor of adopting the RFC and moving the specific implementation discussion to the [Cookbook Quality Metric](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/cookbook-quality-metrics) repo.
  * the community has expressed a need for an aggregate metric to make the quality ranking easy to consume without needing to fully understand what makes up the metric
    * Anyone should be able to understand how the score was determined
  * Nothing should be viewable by default until we've gathered and can inspect the data
