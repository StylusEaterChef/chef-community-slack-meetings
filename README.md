# Chef Community Meetings

This repository keeps the agenda, minutes, and log from the [Chef Community IRC Meetings](https://github.com/opscode/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc001-irc-meetings.md).

## How to use this repository

The agenda for the next meeting should be set as a file marked with YYYY-MM-DD-agenda.md
in the top level directory. When the meeting is complete, a subdirectory that matches
the YYYY-MM-DD of the meeting should be created, with three files:

* YYYY-MM-DD-agenda.md: the agenda
* YYYY-MM-DD-meeting_transcript.pdf: a full transcript of the meeting
* YYYY-MM-DD-minutes.md: The meeting minutes as recorded by the secretary

A new agenda file should be created, using the standard agenda linked [in the RFC](https://github.com/opscode/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc001-irc-meetings.md) along with pre-set
topics and speakers that may have been decided in the meeting.
