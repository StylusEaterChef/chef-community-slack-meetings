# Chef Community Meetings

This repository keeps the agenda, minutes, and log from the [Chef Community Slack Meetings](https://github.com/opscode/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc001-slack-meetings.md).

## How to use this repository

Pull Requests to [chef/chef-rfc](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc) can
be in 5 states: New, Under Discussion, Ready for Vote, Approved, On Hold. There are appropriate labels for every state that isn't "New".

To generate an agenda, run `bundle exec rake`. Any unlabelled issues
will be added to the agenda as new items, items labelled as "Under
Discussion" or "Ready for Vote" will be placed appropriately. 

The meeting secretary should then apply and change labels appropriately
as the meeting progresses.
