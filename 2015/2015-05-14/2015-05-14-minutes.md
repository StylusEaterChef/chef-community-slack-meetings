Meeting called to order by Nathen Harvey (nathenharvey) - 

### Chef Software Update

### Community Update

* Please take the Cookbook Survey - http://bit.ly/chefconf2015-cookbook-survey
* Chef Community Summit - http://summit.chef.io - October 14-15, 2015 in Seattle
* Scouting locations for the London summit, details as they're available
  * Some of us meeting up Saturday night
* ChefConf 2016 dates will likely change to avoid a conflict with Microsoft Ignite


### Chef Client and Server Update

* working on a chefkdk release for early next week with additional goodness around policyfile support
* The 12.1.0 release has been delayed because our Hosted environment and a couple of our high-scale users have seen evidence of serious performance regressions. We want to fix these regressions before the 12.1.0 RC.
* If you want or need to start testing the 12.1.0 release immediately, you can test the builds that we publish to the "current" packagecloud.io repository:  https://packagecloud.io/chef/current

### [Fix small mistake and add min / max headers to versioning rfc.](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/123)
* Status:  Approved

### [Initial draft of an ohai configuration specification](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/118)
* Status:  Ongoing
* Discussion:
  * [chef-config gem](https://github.com/chef/chef/pull/3270)
  * Will move forward with chef-config before approving this RFC
  * Dan DeLeo (kallistec) and BTM will review and update as required to better reflect chef-config 
  
### [Add the ability to run resources immediately after declaration](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/126)
* Status:  Ongoing
* Discussion:
  * Allowing some resources and recipes to execute immediately may be super confusing
  * Order matters and living in a world where some are immediate and some are delayed makes everything very difficult to reason about
  * Hybrid solution makes things more difficult, not easier
  * We need concrete scenarios and an experiment to continue
