Meeting called to order by Nathen Harvey (nathenharvey) - 16:02 UTC

### Chef release process - nightlies and feature flags
* Discussion
  * mission is to get bug fixes and features in development into the hands of 
  users and customers as quickly as possible
  * heading towards more frequent, even continuous, releases of CHEF software.
  * we've been adding feature flags and incrementally delivering new features.
  * In the next few weeks, we'll have the infrastructure in place to make 
  nightlies available via our PackageCloud apt and yum repositories.
  * we'll also be rolling out another "channel" for OmniTruck, the web service 
  that backs the `curl install.sh | bash` installation method for chef-client 
  and chefdk. This will allow users outside of the apt and yum ecosystems to get 
  in on the nightly action.

  

### [On Demand Cookbook Libraries RFC](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/93)
* Status:  Merged
* Discussion
  * This will break other tools like stove and ridley
  * May need a new library for parsing the metadata.rb so these tools don't need to reinvent the wheel
  * Out of scope:  Being more clear about which metadata fields are "for documentation only" (eg, suggests)

### [Specify the quanitity of each role](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/95)
* Status:  Merged

### [Restrict search to current environment by default](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/96)
* Status:  Closed, not merging
* Suggested an RFC to create a new search DSL

### [Remove roadmapping as an LT responsibility](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/97)
* Status: Merged
* Discussion:
  * LTs, maintainers, and the entire community should be involved in the future direction of Chef.
  * a structure that has LTs telling people what to do is not actually the right way to think about running an open source project
  * Bryan McLellan will create a new RFC describing a way for LTs to share future direction, maybe a ROADMAP.md in the project
  
### [Lcg/node state separation](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/100)
* Status: needs additional updates
* Discussion:
  * Use "/desired" and "/current"
  * ACLs must be fixed
  * Current should be mutable and often dirtied by a chef-client run
  * Desired should not often be updated by the node  

### [adding add-yum_repository-to-core](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/101)
* Status:  closed, RFC not needed
* Discussion:
  * LTs can drive whether or not additional core resources are added for their component

### [Reopen RFC 28, Mailing List Migration](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/103)
* Status:  Unresolved
* Discussion:
  * We ran out of time and will pick this up at the next meeting.
