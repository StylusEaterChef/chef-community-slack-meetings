# Old Business
## RFC for detailing nightly builds and stable release
* Status: Progress from Legion of Builds and Quality and Tools?
  * Nothing to report yet - still pending

## [Dialects in Chef](https://github.com/opscode/chef-rfc/pull/71)
* Status: Merged

## [RFC for Ruby data bag items](https://github.com/opscode/chef-rfc/pull/79)      
* Status: Stalled 
* Discussion
  * should this belong as part of the dialects work
* Tabled for review of stalled status

## [Allow specifying partial templates during bootstrap](https://github.com/opscode/chef-rfc/pull/82)
* Status: Ranjib is going to reformat, still pending further discussions
* Discussion
  *  Doing both this and kallistec's bootstrapper changes
  *  Still debating use of wrapping templates (per mikethemilkman's suggestion)
* Tabled for the next meeting
  
## [Recipe DSL method for event handlers](https://github.com/opscode/chef-rfc/pull/83)
* Status: still being revised by ranjib
* Discussion
  * example changed to reflect not being able to hook all events
  * Chef.on can be used anywhere, including config files
  * Suggested that the event handler dsl be separate, like Chef.event_handler do; on(:event_name) {code} end
  * That adds support for things like Chef.event_handler(dsl_version: 2)
* Tabled for the next meeting

## [Add client_compat field to cookbook metadata](https://github.com/opscode/chef-rfc/pull/84)
* Status: needs Adam(holoway)'s approval, then ready to merge
* Discussion
  * General approval
  * Going to require server changes as well (since chef-server expects specific metadata)
* Tabled for next meeting

# New Business

## [Updating RFCs](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/85)
* Status: needs Adam(holoway)'s approval, then ready to merge
* Discussion
  * There wasn't an existing process for changing an existing RFC
  * Anything that wasn't "final" could be updated in place
  * Final RFCs need to be replaced, this would add a backlink to the metadata as to which RFC is being replaced.
  * Most in favor
* Tabled for next meeting

## [Update the maintenance policy to accelerate code review and merge](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/88)
