##### Discussion of attribute syntax API

[Chef RFC Pull Request 40](https://github.com/opscode/chef-rfc/pull/40)

Adam Jacob suggested we deprecate the node.foo.bar syntax and approve the RFC provided other changes can be made without compromising backward compatibility.

**Action Item:**  Steven Danna (ssd7) Clean-up the PR based on comments and note the deprecation of dot syntax.

There was some additional discussion about the RFC.  Decided we need more revieew and comments before merging

**Action Item:** Everyone - Comment on the [RFC](https://github.com/opscode/chef-rfc/pull/40) and finalize for the next meeting.

**Action Item:** Scott Hain (shain) will make a search RFC.

##### Discussion of RFC Workflow

[Chef RFC Pull Request 37](https://github.com/opscode/chef-rfc/pull/37)

A discussion of the RFC process. Big thanks to Noah Kantrowitz for reasearching and writing up the RFC!

**Action Item:** - Noah Kantrowitz (coderanger) - Clarify the process of becoming  editor (submit a PR to the RFC, simple majority of editors, veto power of the decider).

**Action Item:** - Noah Kantrowitz (coderanger) - License will be changed so all work in the repo is published under CC0, which means public domain

##### Discussion of RFC to standardize on two Chef workflows

This PR was prompted, in part, by feedback, comments, etc. gathered during the Berkshelf Riot of 2014.

[Chef RFC Pull Request 34](https://github.com/opscode/chef-rfc/pull/34)

This RFC is meant to "bless" two different development workflows for developing Chef infrastructure code and to build an abstraction that brings those two workflows as close together as possible in daily use.  This way, documentation, tool builders, and end users have less confusion when moving between them

The two different workflows:

* monolithic repository workflow
* independent software projects workflow

There was a lot of discussion about the use of the word "supported" and an action item was created as a result.

**Action Item:** - Noah Kantrowitz (coderanger) & Sean O'Meara (someara) - Clarify meaning of "supported"

**Action Item:** - Adam Jacob (holoway) - Clean up the [pull request](https://github.com/opscode/chef-rfc/pull/34) and prepare to finalize it during our next meeting.
