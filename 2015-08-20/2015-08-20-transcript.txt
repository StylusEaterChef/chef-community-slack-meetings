12:01 < nathenharvey> ***** MEETING BEGINS *****
12:01 < nathenharvey> we have a relatively short agenda for today - https://github.com/chef/chef-community-irc-meetings/blob/master/2015-08-20-agenda.md
12:02 < nathenharvey> I'll start with the community update
12:03 < nathenharvey> We've filled our Cookbook Engineer positions...watch for announcements of who will be working on that and, more importantly, watch for progress in the land of cookbooks
12:03 <@ssd7> w00t
12:03 <@thom> yays
12:04 <@jtimberman> awwyiss
12:04 < nathenharvey> We're still looking for another engineer to join the Community Engineering team working on the Supermarket.  So if you people with some good production Rails experience who'd like to work on an open source project, send them our way
12:04 < nathenharvey> Please register for the Community Summit(s) before the early registration period ends
12:05 <@jtimberman> I'll be giving out free hugs, so you'll want to come just for that, surely.
12:05 < nathenharvey> for Seattle, early registration ends at the end of August
12:05 < nathenharvey> Hope to see you all there!
12:06 < nathenharvey> Also from the community engineering team, Chef Push 2.0-alpha was released yesterday.  Watch the blog for details about that
12:06 <@jonlives> jtimberman: you better be at the UK one too then
12:06 <@jonlives> I don't want to miss out.
12:06 < nathenharvey> adamedx: over to you for updates about Chef
12:06 <@jtimberman> jonlives: ;)
12:06 < adamedx> Thanks
12:07 < adamedx> We did meet our goal of not having to say ChefDK 0.7.0 release is pending -- it's out now
12:07 < adamedx> So please upgrade your workflow to it, especially if you're on Windows
12:07 < adamedx> related to that
12:07 < adamedx> a key focus at Chef
12:07 < adamedx> is making it easier to get productive with Chef quickly
12:08 < adamedx> so you'll see a lot of enhancements throughout the Chef tooling, especially ChefDK
12:08 < adamedx> around making things easy. An example is the CHEFDK_HOME variable which helps on Windows
12:09 < adamedx> to avoid defaulting to storing data / code in network locations where things break at runtime
12:09 < adamedx> other examples include anything around web proxy configurations
12:09 < adamedx> I'd like to ask
12:10 < adamedx> that if you have an itch for something that should be easy
12:10 < adamedx> but is not
12:10 < adamedx> that you encounter or you see friends / colleagues hit
12:10 < adamedx> to please file that and / or
12:10 < adamedx> submit a PR :)
12:11 < adamedx> along with making it easier to gain more Chef community members
12:11 <@thom> we should mention https://feedback.chef.io too for people who might not have a github account
12:11 < adamedx> yes, good point thom  ^^^
12:11 < adamedx> as we finish up some feature work around PolicyFile support
12:12 < adamedx> we want to do a major version bump of ChefDK to 1.0 in the next several weeks
12:12 < adamedx> all right
12:12 < adamedx> that's it for me
12:12 < adamedx> over to you nathenharvey
12:13 < nathenharvey> thanks, adamedx!
12:13 < nathenharvey> Our one PR for today is Plugin configuration getter DSL - https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/146
12:13 < nathenharvey> looks like this might be ready for approval and merge
12:14 < nathenharvey> thom: is our decider today so....over to you thom
12:15 < lamont_oc> thom already gave it a +1
12:15 <@thom> yeah, i think this has enough votes now
12:15 <@jonlives> yeah
12:15 <@thom> so i will get out the rubber stamp and deciderate it
12:15 < nathenharvey> excellent!
12:16 < nathenharvey> that leaves us with 35 minutes for open discussion if there are topics anyone here would like to bring up
12:16 <@jonlives> nathenharvey: if we have few, any updates on the CBGB?
12:17 < nathenharvey> yes and no.  the coordination work for CBGB has been delegated from holoway to me and Karolin Beck.  Alas, we've not made much progress on that yet though.
12:17 < nathenharvey> My objective is to have a meaningful update no later than the Community Summit in Seattle
12:17 <@jonlives> awesome sauce!
12:18 < nathenharvey> I don't know that we'll have the board assembled by then but will have a process for how it gets assembled articulated
12:18 <@jonlives> that's fair
12:19 < nathenharvey> any other topics y'all would like to discuss today?
12:20 < nathenharvey> going once ....
12:21 < nathenharvey> going twice ...
12:22 < nathenharvey> sold!  thank you for joining today, we'll see everyone back here in a week. Enjoy the bonus 28 minutes of free time in your calendar ;)
12:22 < nathenharvey> **** MEETING ENDS *****
