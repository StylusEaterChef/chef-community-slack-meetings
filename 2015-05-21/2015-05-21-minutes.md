Meeting called to order by Steven Murawski (stevenmurawski) -

### Chef Software Update

### Community Update

* Please take the Cookbook Survey - http://bit.ly/chefconf2015-cookbook-survey
* Chef Community Summit - http://summit.chef.io - October 14-15, 2015 in Seattle
* Still searching for a location for the London summit, more details as they're available.
* ChefConf 2016 dates will likely change to avoid a conflict with Microsoft Ignite.

### Chef Client and Server Update

* chef-config gem was extracted from Chef and can be used for other projects.
* Thom May is working on a client release, with more details to be sent to the mailing list.
* For server, 12.1 is underway.

### [Add resource current value loading to actions, and converge helper](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/127)
* Status:

### [Add "property" to resource](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/128)
* Status: Ongoing
* Discussion:
  * Current use of `attribute` is confusing to new users
  * Existing `attribute` declarations will continue to work identically.  New `property` syntax is introduced.  `attribute` becomes an alias for that.
  * There will be some new options for `property` as well.

### [Ubuntu 10.04 LTS is no longer a supported platform.](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/129)
* Status: Ongoing
* Discussion:
  * General consensus is that it should be moved to Tier 2 support, rather than moved to unsupported.
  * Matt Ray will be requested to revise the PR to reflect that.

### [Propose moving OpenBSD 5.7+ i386 and amd64 into Tier 2 support](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/130)
* Status: Ongoing
* Discussion:
  * Lots of interesting in adding the platform
  * We'll need a maintainer and packages, which means Chef Software would need to add OpenBSD to the build infrastructure

### [Remove method_missing and make Chef::Resource unspecial](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/117) - ready for merge
* Status: Deferred to next meeting

### [Initial draft of an ohai configuration specification](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/118)
  * [chef-config gem](https://github.com/chef/chef/pull/3270)
