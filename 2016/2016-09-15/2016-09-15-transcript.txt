MEETING STARTS

[16:02]
hi, as just discussed, we've got no RFCs to discuss. But there are some announcements, so I'll just go through those, and then if there's any other business, we can take that

[16:03]
Community Summits: registration is open for both London and Seattle summits; see https://summit.chef.io for details and to buy tickets (edited)

[16:04]
There are definitely updates on softwareâ€¦

robbkidd [16:05 PM]
Supermarket 2.8.25 released with security updates upgrading the embedded PostgreSQL https://github.com/chef/supermarket/releases/tag/2.8.25 (edited)

thom [16:05 PM]
we released Chef 12.14.60 yesterday; we know of a couple of regressions and are targetting a new release to correct those for Monday. The regressions are around the yum_repository resource (as compared to the cookbook), the user resource (manage_home behaves a little differently in some situations), and systemd_unit

[16:06]
I've been generating the RFCs as html, and they're available on the internets at http://chef.github.io/chef-rfc/ ; hopefully it's a bit easier to see what's going on there

[16:07]
Please everyone review your RFCs and update them with tracking urls or changes of status if required

tas50 [16:07 PM]
chefspec 5.1.0 has been released with new dsc_script and yum_repository matchers plus fixes to the examples

[16:07]
and fauxhai 3.9.0 with new platforms for chefspec

robbkidd [16:08 PM]
(for the logs, correction: Supermarket 2.8.25 released)

thom [16:10 PM]
does anyone have Any Other Business?

I'm presuming we'll put the next ChefDK on hold until at least we get another Chef 12.14 release out. Some Chef folks are investigating a possible ChefDK regression in current right now too.

[16:12]
(normally we'd cut a ChefDK pre-release tomorrow)

thom [16:20 PM]
ok, that looks like that's it. Thanks everyone
