I want to share news about two cookbooks we've been working on here at Chef for Habitat. First is the `habitat` cookbook. This cookbook includes resources for managing Habitat installation, packags, and services. It will be extended over time to add more functionality related to habitat such as configuration files, gossip management, and more. It's published on Supermarket, source is on Github.

https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/habitat
https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/habitat

The second is the `habitat-build` cookbook. This is build cookbook for Chef Automate workflow to build habitat packages and publish them to a depot. It makes use of the `habitat` cookbook's resources :slightly_smiling_face:. It's available on Github.

If you're a cookbook developer, you can use the `chef/chef:current` image in kitchen-dokken to test against the latest pre-release build from our current channel. Details on how to do that can be found here: https://discourse.chef.io/t/use-chef-chef-current-in-kitchen-dokken/10002

Use chef/chef:current in kitchen-dokken
Hey y'all! We've been doing some work behind the scenes to help improve your test experience with Kitchen. One of those improvements includes kitchen-dokken images fed directly from our release channels! Head over to chef/chef on the Docker Hub to check out these images. As of kitchen-dokken 1.0.9, the default image will be our chef:chef/latest image. This tag is tied to whatever version of Chef was most recently promoted to Stable. If you are using kitchen-dokken 1.0.9 today, no action is n...

[12:09]
By using the `chef/chef:current` image, you can help identify potential regressions or breaking changes before they are officially promoted to stable.

We chatted about it here during the RFC process, but we now have a deprecations page up on the docs site. https://docs.chef.io/chef_deprecations_client.html will track all our deprecations going forward. We already have PRs flowing to add more for the Chef 13 release so keep an eye on the page

Enhancements Admin-Only Quality Metrics: In the effort to add new quality metrics to the system, metrics can now be flagged as only visible to Supermarket admins.

thanks for the link expansion, :slack: :disappointed:

lamont [12:14 PM]
yo dawg i heard you liked links…

nathenharvey [12:14 PM]
any other notable releases that anyone would like to link to?

cheeseplus [12:15 PM]
there was the kitchen-vagrant and test-kitchen releases to enable caching

nathenharvey [12:16 PM]
thanks everyone!

[12:17]
Please also take a few minutes to review the list of currently accepted RFCs.  Are any updates required?  https://chef.github.io/chef-rfc/

[12:17]
And we'll move into our PRs to review.  we have 2 new and 4 that have been previously discussed

[12:17]
we'll start with the new ones, first up:

PR 244 - Test Kitchen Multi-Server Testing - https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/244

🚧 Test Kitchen Multi-Server Testing by coderanger · Pull Request #244 · chef/chef-rfc · GitHub

[12:19]
I don't see @coderanger online at the moment.  He's likely busy conferencing at LISA

shortdudey123 [12:19 PM]
The RFC is based on some chat at chef summit this year so i know several people are looking forward to it :slightly_smiling_face:

nathenharvey [12:21 PM]
indeed!  absent @coderanger at this meeting, I'd like to ask folks to review and comment on the PR and we'll move on to the next one on our agenda

[12:21]
PR 245 - RFC for removing unused metadata fields - https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/245

jccastillocano [12:23 PM]
joined #developer-meetings

shortdudey123 [12:23 PM]
Looks pretty straight forward and low impact

cheeseplus [12:23 PM]
I'm reading it through and looking at the implementation details we need to sort

[12:23]
(for 244 train internet is laggy)

shortdudey123 [12:23 PM]
i haven't seen any external tooling rely on those fields unless someone else has

tas50 [12:24 PM]
I’m fairly certain nothing has ever consumed those other than people reading the fields and hand uploading cookbooks

[12:25]
which “sorta” worked in 2009

nathenharvey [12:25 PM]
I also believe @thom is unavailable today and this PR is only 2 days old.  So, please review and comment in the PR itself if you have any additional feedback or concerns.

[12:25]
I'll make sure both are also on next week's agenda

[12:27]
I've missed a couple of these meeting so I'm not sure if we previously reached a conclusion on this one

lamont [12:28 PM]
no, i don’t think we’ve really discussed it

[12:28]
at least i don’t recall

shortdudey123 [12:28 PM]
Wasn't discussed here last week at least (edited)

nathenharvey [12:31 PM]
there is some discussion in the PR itself.  anyone have additional things they'd like to discuss here today on this one?

lamont [12:31 PM]
i just threw out the only comment i’ve got

nathenharvey [12:32 PM]
again, doesn't look like we have @jaymzh or Zeal here.  I don't think we actually have a decider here today either with @holoway, @thom, and @jonlives absent.

mostly crickets on that RFC since last time

nathenharvey [12:37 PM]
reviewing some of the transcripts, it seemed like perhaps this was going to be addressed without the need for the PR?

[12:38]
@chip should this be closed?

chip [12:38 PM]
Thom & I had a conversation about it

[12:39]
I'm not personally convinced the issue has gone away. We've still identified cases where people have to think about the format of their metadata file, or might wind up with cookbooks that don't have a metadata.rb.

[12:39]
But it doesn't sound like there's a lot of momentum to fix it right now either

[12:40]
And I don't have time to invest until mid-q1

[12:40]
So I guess that means close, but unsatisfactory outcome. (edited)

nathenharvey [12:41 PM]
we can put it "on hold", too.  we've certainly a precedence for that.  perhaps someone else would want to pick-up advocating for this in the meantime?

[12:42]
That leaves us with 8 minutes and one more PR on our agenda.

[12:42]
PR 241 - Add critical non maintained cookbooks to RFC069 - https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/241
 GitHub
Add critical non-maintained cookbooks to RFC069 by shortdudey123 · Pull Request #241 · chef/chef-rfc · GitHub
This adds provisions for transfering a cookbook on supermarket to a new owner in cases where the cookbook is major / critical and the owner is not reachable and not actively maintaining the cookbook.



shortdudey123 [12:43 PM]
I think the general consensus was this is a supermarket discovery issue and can probably be closed unless anyone has any further commends or questions

[12:44]
Would love to help figure out the discoverability side though :stuck_out_tongue:

nathenharvey [12:44 PM]
I'm generally :-1: on this change if only because I believe it's already covered by the existing RFC.  An RFC should be opened and would be handled on a case-by-case basis

[12:44]
the cookbook quality metrics (https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/cookbook-quality-metrics) are the first step in improving discoverability of better cookbooks
 GitHub

[12:45]
recommendation of and/or implementation of additional metrics would certainly be welcomed!

lamont [12:46 PM]
i remain skeptical of cookbook quality metrics, and feel that users are going to want a “frobnicator” cookbook that just works for “frobnicator” and not have to go looking for “frobnicator_ng2_simple_fixed_continued" — but, i think we’ve argued about it enough for this round and can move on...

nathenharvey [12:46 PM]
sounds like PR-241 can be closed without merging though.  Are you OK with that @shortdudey123?

shortdudey123 [12:47 PM]
Closed :slightly_smiling_face:

lamont [12:47 PM]
:+1:

nathenharvey [12:47 PM]
ok, that brings us to the end of our agenda for today as well.

[12:48]
I'll carry some of the PRs we discussed today forward to next week's agenda

[12:48]
Next week's meeting (Thursday, December 15, 2016 9AM-9:50AM PST) will be the final meeting of 2016

[12:48]
After that meeting, we will observe a Winter Break from our weekly meetings and resume on Thursday, January 19

Thank you!
