[12:04]
That’s it for the community update today.

[12:04]
I don’t see @holoway here so we’ll skip over the Chef company updates.

[12:04]
Let’s move on to Software Updates.

[12:05]
I know @jkeiser has some updates and there may be others of you here with news about software that is about to ship or has recently shipped.  Take it away....

jkeiser [12:06 PM]
The Chef and ChefDK `current` channel is now running Ruby 2.3.1! Ruby 2.1 is no longer supported (it’s EOL and many rubygems have dropped support).

[12:06]
Try them and let us know if you have issues.

[12:07]
Also, we’re releasing new major versions of other gems to allow us to pick up later versions of json, rack, and other things which don’t support 2.1 at all. If you have unconstrained references in your Gemfile and start getting “ruby version >= 2.2.2 required”, either upgrade Ruby or constrain to the previous major version, and you will be fine

[12:07]
cheffish, chef-zero, and many others are already moved over and released, and we’re working on many others

[12:08]
That’s it for that. Let us know if you have issues!

[12:08]
Back to you, @nathenharvey

nathenharvey [12:09 PM]
Thanks, @jkeiser!

[12:10]
Anyone else have software updates?

jtimberman [12:10 PM]

OK.  Our one outstanding PR this week is PR-213 - Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) - https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/213
 GitHub
Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) by nathenharvey · Pull Request #213 · chef/chef-rfc · GitHub
Chef's open source projects will no longer require a contributor license agreement (CLA) or corporate contributor license agreement (CCLA). A developer certificate of origin (DCO) will be required...


(edited)

[12:16]
The update on that PR is that I’m working with Chef’s legal counsel on whether or not we can move forward with a single sign-off in a collection of commits that make up the same change / pr.  And for other options that make the user experience a bit more friendly to contributors. (edited)

[12:17]
While they’re looking into that, there’s not much point to discuss that PR further here so I’m going to add it to next week’s agenda and work to get some better direction from them before that meeting.

nathenharvey [12:19 PM]
that covers everything on today’s agenda.  I’ll open the floor for any additional items that you’d like to discuss...
