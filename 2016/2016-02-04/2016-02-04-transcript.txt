11:00 AM <stevenmurawski> **** Meeting Starts! ****
11:00 AM <stevenmurawski> Welcome to the Chef Developer IRC Meeting for February 4th, 2016!
11:00 AM <stevenmurawski> Our agenda is https://github.com/chef/chef-community-irc-meetings/blob/master/2016/2016-01-21/2016-01-21-agenda.md
11:00 AM <@holoway> it's looking like a short one today
11:00 AM <stevenmurawski> Yep
11:00 AM <stevenmurawski> Just our updates and one PR
11:00 AM <@holoway> pretty sure its https://github.com/chef/chef-community-irc-meetings/blob/master/2016-02-04-agenda.md
11:01 AM <stevenmurawski> argh
11:01 AM <stevenmurawski> copy paste fail
11:01 AM <stevenmurawski> thanks holoway
11:01 AM <stevenmurawski> For the community update, ChefConf 2016 (Austin, TX / July 11-13) details have been posted (https://chefconf.chef.io/) and the call for papers is open! (https://chefconf.chef.io/call-for-presentations/)
11:01 AM <stevenmurawski> And that's pretty much all I have for this week's update on community.
11:02 AM <stevenmurawski> holoway, anything you'd like to share as an update from Chef Software?
11:02 AM <@holoway> Chef Software continues to move along :)
11:02 AM <@holoway> adamedx: 
11:02 AM <adamedx> Thank you holoway 
11:02 AM <@holoway> adamedx: want client and server?
11:03 AM <adamedx> Next week we will release Chef Client 12.7
11:03 AM <adamedx> The goodness is here: https://github.com/chef/chef/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
11:03 AM <adamedx> Also
11:04 AM <adamedx> We now have publicly available versions of 64-bit Chef Client for Windows
11:04 AM <adamedx> On our current channel (not the download site)
11:04 AM <adamedx> These are not stable builds, but you can try them out, and they are up to date with the latest changes in the chef repository
11:04 AM <adamedx> To install
11:04 AM <adamedx> . { iwr -useb https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.ps1 } | iex; install -channel current -project chef
11:04 AM <adamedx> From PowerShell
11:05 AM <adamedx> Eventually (not with next week's 12.7 release), that version of Chef will be the default for 64-bit versions of Windows (if you're not familiar with the 32-bit Ruby on 64-bit Chef conundrum, don't worry, everyone else will get it :) )
11:05 AM <adamedx> Ok, that's it for me.
11:06 AM <adamedx> On to the next thing stevenmurawski
11:06 AM <stevenmurawski> thanks adamedx
11:06 AM <@holoway> looks like we only have https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/183/files
11:06 AM <stevenmurawski> There are no follow up action items from the last meeting, so into new PRs
11:06 AM <stevenmurawski> yep
11:06 AM <stevenmurawski> jaym: 
11:06 AM <jaym> yes
11:07 AM <stevenmurawski> anything you want to share about the pr or just looking for more discussion?
11:07 AM <jaym> so the tldr is we'd like knife bootstrap to be flexible enough to the right thing on the first converge
11:07 AM <jaym> and there are 2 proposals for adding some flexibility in that PR
11:07 AM <jaym> the first one is to have a client.d directory in your chef-repo's bootstrap folder that will get uploaded and loaded as part of the client.rb
11:08 AM <jaym> the second one is to make client.rb a template you can pass to knife bootstrap
11:08 AM <jaym> after writing the rfc, i think the first one is the good one
11:08 AM <jaym> the second way is overly complicated and i would never use it if we had the first one
11:09 AM <@holoway> that feels legit to me
11:09 AM <@holoway> anyone prefer option 2?
11:09 AM <jaym> btw, option 1 was btm's idea, option 2 was mine
11:09 AM <jonlives> I like the RFC as stands, seems eminently sensible (option 1)
11:10 AM <@btm> jaym: I cheated by thinking about it all before asking you to write it. :)
11:10 AM <jaym> hehe
11:10 AM <stevenmurawski> +1 for option 1
11:10 AM <@holoway> ok
11:10 AM <@btm> for years. so +1 for client.d folder and ship bits to it.
11:10 AM <@holoway> lets do it
11:11 AM <jaym> \o/
11:11 AM <jaym> i'm gonna delete the template stuff
11:11 AM <jaym> any thoughts on the UX?
11:11 AM <lamont_oc2> yeah +1 on #1
11:11 AM <jaym> feel right?
11:12 AM <@btm> jaym: not sure that we'd need to override --client_d_dir or not. we should be sure that it defaults to like $ChefConfigDir/client.d or whatever.
11:13 AM <@btm> curious about other peoples feelings on a flag for --client_d_dir?
11:13 AM <jaym> yep, it may not be needed
11:14 AM <jaym> i run knife from my chef repos
11:14 AM <@holoway> I think if you have the sane default, and it's changable from within client.rb, you're fine
11:14 AM <jonlives> i wouldn't have a need for it myself, but I guess others might.
11:14 AM <@holoway> I don't know that you need a cli flag
11:14 AM <jonlives> ^ yeah what holoway said
11:14 AM <@holoway> ie: "client_partials_path" or whatever
11:15 AM <@btm> I guess just make sure we have a use case before we add a CLI arg for it.
11:15 AM <@holoway> right
11:15 AM <@holoway> I don't think you need a CLI arg for it, and I would resist until you don't have a choice
11:15 AM <jaym> fair enough, ill change that to knife.rb config
11:16 AM <jaym> client_partials_path or client_d_dir or client_d_path
11:17 AM <stevenmurawski> I like client_d_path
11:17 AM <@holoway> works for me
11:17 AM <@btm> client_shed_path :D
11:17 AM <jaym> can we?
11:18 AM â€” @btm high fives jaym
11:18 AM <stevenmurawski> :)
11:18 AM <stevenmurawski> Do we have any other colors to paint this one?
11:18 AM <@holoway> ok - lets ship it
11:18 AM <@holoway> and on that note, I think we're done
11:18 AM <@holoway> yes?
11:19 AM <stevenmurawski> unless you've got anything else you wanted to share
11:19 AM <jaym> yes
11:19 AM <@holoway> I'll see my CBGB peers in San Francisco soon
11:19 AM <@holoway> looking forward to spending the day with y'all
11:19 AM <stevenmurawski> Thanks everyone!
11:19 AM <stevenmurawski> **** Meeting Ends! ****
