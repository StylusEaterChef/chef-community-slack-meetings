### [PR-183 - Knife bootstrap custom client.rb config](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/183)
* Status:  Approved
* Discussion:
  * allow additional more client.rb configuration from bootstrap
  * bootstrap will take a `client.d` folder and sync all the files under it to the bootstrap client.
  * location of configuration files will be controlled by a configuration option, rather than a cli switch.
