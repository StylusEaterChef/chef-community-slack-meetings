hello, and welcome to the Developer's meeting for the 11th of August

[16:02]
Nathen and Adam are both on holiday this week

[16:02]
We've got one RFC to look through; the agenda is just above here

[16:03]
in terms of community updates, not much has changed. Tickets for the London summit are on sale, https://summit.chef.io

[16:04]
Seattle summit will be four days, with a habitat day and a hack day, so get that in your calendar

[16:06]
that's it for community updates. We've done a bunch of releases recently; Chef and the Push Jobs client yesterday, and also the Push Jobs server last week

[16:07]
anyone got any further updates they'd like to share?

We released Chef 12.13.30 yesterday. Up for download at the usual places.

[16:07]
Big change there is Ohai .18

[16:07]
With lots of nice OS/X stuff

[16:07]
We've also announced that as of Chef 12.14, Solaris 10u11 will be the only Solaris 10 version supported.

[16:08]
This buys us nice things, including full IPv6 support.

[16:09]
No other client release info :slightly_smiling_face:

thom [16:09 PM]
we'll also be moving to ruby 2.3, right?

jkeiser [16:09 PM]
Yeah, I have a change in the pipeline now, if it passes we’ll be on Ruby 2.3 in Chef soon.

[16:10]
Next week we’ll release ChefDK with Ruby 2.1.9 (matching Chef), and after that we’ll be weapons-free on Ruby 2.3

thom [16:10 PM]
:+1:

jkeiser [16:10 PM]
We’ll send an announcement and would love people to pay special attention to this one—download, try, tell us if there are issues

[16:10]
Ruby sometimes throws curveballs in minor releases

thom [16:12 PM]
cool, thanks john. let's move on to our one RFC of the day, which is about moving away from using CLAs to using the Developer Certificate of Origin

lamont [16:12 PM]
also note that going to ruby 2.3 also pretty much pulls in deprecating ruby 2.1 — berkshelf 5.0.0 is staged on master and will drop support for 2.1 and add support for 2.3/2.4

Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) by nathenharvey · Pull Request #213 · chef/chef-rfc · GitHub
Chef's open source projects will no longer require a contributor license agreement (CLA) or corporate contributor license agreement (CCLA). A developer certificate of origin (DCO) will be required...


[16:14]
as mentioned Nathen's not here, but I think the RFC does a good job of explaining why we're doing this

[16:14]
and how we'll do it

[16:15]
why do we not have the tumbleweed emoji in here

chip [16:16 PM]
nobody signed the emoji certificate of origin

ssd [16:16 PM]
The only comment on the PR that isn't directly addressed is from @coderanger:
> As a way to make life simpler for and keep commits a little less cluttered, can we write this in such a way that all commits from maintainers count as good?

robbkidd [16:16 PM]
I think that _was_ addressed.

ssd [16:16 PM]
Oh, was it?

thom [16:16 PM]
@ssd i think i addressed that right after?

[16:17]
or rather robb did and i agreed

robbkidd [16:17 PM]
My comment was that exempting official maintainers makes the automation around verifying commits difficult.

ssd [16:18 PM]
Ah, OK. Yes, I failed my reading test for today. (edited)

[16:18]
:smile:

robbkidd [16:18 PM]
I wish git CLI had a config file option for "--sign-off" instead of requiring it as a switch.

[16:18]
But that's what shell aliases are for.

thom [16:18 PM]
i mashed in a commit template

tas50 [16:19 PM]
aliases

[16:19]
alias gc="git commit -v -S"

robbkidd [16:19 PM]
`-s -S` for sign and gpg-sign.

ssd [16:20 PM]
Well, git aliases aside, I think this one is good to go then?

thom [16:20 PM]
needs more +1s

[16:21]
but yes, once the votes are in we're gravy

tas50 [16:21 PM]
just keep in mind we’re gonna need some nice docs on cleaning up commits for new users. This is going to cause a lot of confusion for first time committers that have 5 commits missing the signature

thom [16:21 PM]
so i'm gonna wrap up here unless there's any other business?

[16:21]
yeah

robbkidd [16:21 PM]
I'll kinda miss maintaining a thing named "curry." Can we name the DCO bot that? :smile: (edited)

thom [16:22 PM]
i was gonna call it daal

[16:23]
but anyway

[16:23]
thanks everyone

lamont [16:24 PM]
can we setup a homu bot and start using it for more than DCO but also for workflow?

thom [16:25 PM]
yeah, we'll probably get homu too at some point
