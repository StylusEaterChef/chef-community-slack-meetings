### CBGB Update

* The CBGB is interested in assessing the health of our community and we will be putting together a very brief survey to help with that.  It will likely be only 3-5 questions and weâ€™d really appreciate your participation when that is released
* The state of documentation was discussed and some ideas about how we, as project contributors and maintainers, can do our part to help keep those in better shape.  There are some recommendations that came out of that like lowering the barriers to simple doc changes.
* RFCs should be announced to the community and should have a 14-day review period before being accepted
*  CBGB will recommend a move to Chef 13 and has some suggestions about how we plan for that, how we announce and track breaking changes, etc.
