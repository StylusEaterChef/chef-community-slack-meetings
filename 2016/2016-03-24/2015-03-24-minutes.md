* [ChefConf tickets](https://chefconf.chef.io) are on sale now.  Early bird ends April 17.
  * Contributor Discounts - Contributor discount code: GotChef This gets you an additional $295 off early bird pricing
  * The first day consists of training workshops and a community summit.  Tickets for these are separate.  Please plan accordingly.
* Cautionary tale from the Node community this week - [How one developer just broke Node, Babel and thousands of projects in 11 lines of JavaScript](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/)
  * [No user interface to remove old cookbooks.](https://github.com/chef/supermarket/issues/954)
  * [RFC-069 Cookbook Adoption On Supermarket](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc069-cookbook-adoption.md)
  * [RFC-O72 Cookbook and Cookbook Version Yanking Policy](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc072-artifact-yanking.md)
* A question came up this week...should Cookbooks under https://github.com/chef/chef-cookbooks be part of the Chef maintainer policy.
  * Those cookbooks follow a similar process.
  * They are not part of the main chef project maintainer policy though.
  * Every cookbook in that organization has it's own MAINTAINERS.md file.
* Another question that came up that I felt warrants some repeating here, what about the Obvious Fix policy?  Does that apply to cookbooks?
  * It does indeed, apply to cookbooks and other chef projects.  The cookbooks in that org all share a common CONTRIBUTING.MD that documents the obvious fix policy (https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/community_cookbook_documentation/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.MD#chef-obvious-fix-policy)
  * That policy can also be found in the docs - https://docs.chef.io/community_contributions.html#the-obvious-fix-rule
